# Sensor Fusion and Visualization Project

This project utilizes sensor data to compute and visualize Euler angles using the IMUFusion library. It processes data from gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers to estimate orientation, visualizing these estimations alongside internal algorithm states and recovery flags.

## Key Features

- Sensor data normalization and scaling for clarity.
- Recovery trigger visualization for insight into algorithm behavior.
- Euler angle computation and visualization for orientation estimation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: IMUFusion, Matplotlib, Numpy, CSV, and OS

### Installation
